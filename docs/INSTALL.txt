Installing FFBot
---------------------------------------------------------------------------   

Prerequisites:
   - Linux server, with ability to set cronjobs (or similar scheduler)
   - webserver with SSL support (Telegram's webhook does not work without)
   - php >= 5.4 (tested on 5.6.21, unsure about 7.x)
   - mysql (tested on 5.1.73)


Steps for installing:

0) Check for updates

   Project: https://github.com/Little-Ben/FFBot

   Stable Releases:
     There will be no stable releases at the moment,
     only what's on GitHub!

   Source Code Management (latest but less tested code):
     GitHub (main place for code, issue tracking, pull requests, etc.):    
     https://github.com/Little-Ben/FFBot      
	  
1) Setup a mysql database on your webserver's host

2) Copy files to your web server
   
   Be sure to secure your config folder (e.g. by using .htaccess),
   it MUST NOT be reachable via internet (due to passwords, apikey, etc.)!

3) Create a new Telegram Bot using Telegram's BotFather
   see BOTFATHER.TXT 
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------   
   After finishing the steps from BOTFATHER.txt, return here an go on!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
4) Configuration
   Copy 'config/config_example.json' to 'config/config.json'
   Set all values according your needs,
   especially database and telegram sections
   - bot.admin-id (your telegram id, see bot.log, might be set later)
   - bot.logfile
   - map.meshviewer.url
   - instances.telegram.apikey
   - instances.telegram.bot-backend-url
   - database (whole section)

5) Call FFBot's webinterface ffbot_call.php in a browser.
   This initializes the bot on Telegram side and database.
   check log (config/bot.log) for:
   - initBot: search log for "[BOT]"
   - initDB: search log for "[DB]"
   
   If initialization is completed sucessfully, the following flags 
   in config.json should be turned automatically from 0 to 1:
   - database.initialized
   - instances.telegram.bot-initialized
   
   Search log for [CONFIG] and check config.json for turned values.

6) Open your Bot in Telegram, by typing t.me/your_bot's name 
   in a browser and agree to open in Telegram 
   (app or webinterface is needed).
   Now click START or insert the following line as message
   /start

7) Cronjob
   In order to have current node information in database, a cron job is
   needed to actualize data.

   Please setup a cronjob periodically for the file ffbot_check.php, e.g.
   
   * * * * * cd /home/MYUSER/html/bot && /usr/bin/php /home/MYUSER/html/bot/ffbot_check.php
 
   or with a logfile in config folder
 
   * * * * * cd /home/MYUSER/html/bot && /usr/bin/php /home/MYUSER/html/bot/ffbot_check.php > /home/MYUSER/html/bot/config/ffbot_check.log 2>&1
   
   My advice is to execute it each minute. 
   But consider that with all the batman/alfred/respond stuff, 
   it needs some time until a node alert is shown in Telegram 
   after switching on-/offline state. In my experience a 
   notification needs approx. 5-10 minutes.
   

8) The bot should theoretically work ;-)
   Have fun with it!

Updating FFBot
---------------------------------------------------------------------------   

IMPORTANT: 
Before updating a running installation,
be sure to have a backup of installation files AND database!!!

In order to update do a git pull from yout bot's root directory.
Be sure to compare config_example.json with your config.json, 
so that you do not miss any changes!

I am planing to automate any database updates. 
More information will be given here, if this will be the case.

see ./docs/CHANGELOG.txt for any release notes.
