                    if /alarmtest is issued, this node's LAST_STATE will 
                    be set to 0. So this should be a node that is only in 
                    admin's alarmlist. This node should be online, in 
                    order that /alarmtest can work.

-- bot-admin-id: admin's Telegram id, can be found in second coulumn in log
